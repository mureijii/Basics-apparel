            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Basics is a clothing brand that embraces laid-back looks with loud intent. Our designs revolve around meaningful words and clean visuals â€” not to follow trends, but to reflect mood, mindset, and individuality. It's casual wear that speaks for itself: easy to style, comfortable to wear, and always real. Every piece is made to feel like your favorite from day one.

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that clothing should be an extension of who you are, not a costume. That's why we focus on creating pieces that feel authentic and personal. Our designs are minimal but meaningful, with just enough detail to make them special.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not interested in fast fashion or fleeting trends. Instead, we create timeless pieces that you'll want to wear again and again. Quality over quantity. Substance over style. That's the Basics way.

            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>
              Each design begins with a word or phrase that resonates with us. Something that captures a feeling, a mindset, or a way of being. We then translate that into a visual that's clean, minimal, and impactful.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use high-quality materials and ethical manufacturing processes to ensure that our products are not only beautiful but also built to last. We work with local suppliers and manufacturers whenever possible to reduce our carbon footprint and support our community.

            </p>
            <p>
